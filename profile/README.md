## 👁️ What Is ESP in Tarkov?

ESP stands for *Extra Sensory Perception*—a fancy name for wallhacks. It draws outlines, boxes, names, health bars, distances, and loot indicators right on your screen so you always know what’s around the corner.

Used properly, ESP turns you into the ultimate raid tactician—like having permanent UAV + X-ray vision.

## 🛠️ Different Types of ESP Hacks

🔹 **External ESP** – Overlay on top of the game window, safer but slightly delayed
🔹 **Internal ESP** – Injects directly into the game; faster but higher risk
🔹 **Color-Coded ESP** – Loot and enemies marked by rarity and threat
🔹 **Customizable ESP** – Choose what to display: only players, only loot, etc.

**Most private or premium cheats let you customize ESP to keep it clean and stealthy.**

## ⚠️ Detection Risks & Tips

Tarkov’s anti-cheat (BattlEye) is aggressive. Even ESP can get flagged if used recklessly.

🔐 **Use private/undetected versions only**
🧼 **Spoof your HWID if you’ve been banned before**
🤐 **Avoid obvious movements (e.g., staring through walls too long)**
🎭 **Don’t combine with rage hacks unless you’re ready to risk it all**
